## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Application Architecture

OpenEMR implements a modern PHP architecture with key design patterns:

1. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Core business logic is organized in service classes in the `src/Services` directory
   - Services handle database operations, validation, and business rules
   - Example: `PatientService` manages all patient-related operations, including CRUD functions for patient data

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Uses Symfony's Dependency Injection component
   - The `src/Core/Kernel.php` class initializes the DI container
   - Services can be registered and retrieved from the container

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Implements the Observer pattern using Symfony's EventDispatcher
   - System actions trigger events that can be listened to by other components
   - Example: `PatientCreatedEvent` and `BeforePatientCreatedEvent` allow for hooking into the patient creation process

4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Data access is abstracted through repositories
   - FHIR implementation uses specialized repositories for each resource type
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect uses repositories for client, token, and scope management

### Authentication Flow

The authentication system is sophisticated, supporting multiple authentication methods:

1. **Standard Authentication**
   - User authentication logic is handled in `library/auth.inc.php`
   - Password verification uses secure hashing and salting
   - Session management includes automatic timeout handling

2. **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Authentication**
   - Implemented in `src/RestControllers/AuthorizationController.php`
   - Supports multiple grant types:
     - Authorization Code Grant: Standard web application flow
     - Password Grant: Direct username/password authentication for trusted clients
     - Client Credentials: Machine-to-machine communication
     - Refresh Token: Obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication
   - Public/private key encryption for token signatures
   - Complete OpenID Connect implementation including ID tokens and userinfo endpoints

3. **SMART on FHIR Authentication**
   - Extends OAuth2 for healthcare-specific use cases
   - Specialized scopes for clinical data access
   - Support for context-aware launching from EHRs

### Database Interaction

OpenEMR manages database operations through several methods:

1. **Direct SQL Queries**
   - Legacy code uses function-based SQL operations (`sqlQuery`, `sqlInsert`, etc.)
   - Queries are located in various service classes and library files

2. **Service-based Abstraction**
   - Modern code uses service classes to abstract database operations
   - Example: `PatientService::getAll()` retrieves patient records with filtering options
   - Services handle query building, execution, and result mapping

3. **Database Schema Management**
   - Schema defined in `sql/database.sql`
   - Version-specific upgrade scripts handle database migrations
   - Table relationships maintain data integrity

### API Implementation

The API system is comprehensive and standards-compliant:

1. **RESTful API**
   - Controllers in `src/RestControllers` handle API endpoints
   - Resources follow standard REST conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - JSON-based request and response formats
   - Example: `PatientRestController` handles patient resource endpoints

2. **FHIR API Implementation**
   - R4 compliant implementation in `src/FHIR/R4`
   - Resources built as proper FHIR objects
   - Controllers specific to FHIR operations (`src/RestControllers/FHIR`)
   - Supports search parameters based on FHIR specifications

3. **API Request Processing Flow**
   1. Request received through `_rest_routes.inc.php`
   2. Appropriate controller class instantiated
   3. Authentication and authorization performed
   4. Request parameters validated
   5. Service layer executes business logic
   6. Response formatted and returned

### Form Handling

The system uses a sophisticated approach to clinical forms:

1. **Form Definition**
   - Forms defined in database tables
   - Layout control for form fields
   - Custom fields can be added to standard forms

2. **Form Rendering**
   - Templates handle the visual display of forms
   - Dynamic rendering based on form definitions
   - Responsive layouts for different devices

3. **Form Processing**
   - Data validation at both client and server sides
   - Form submission handlers process and store data
   - Data is stored in structured format for retrieval and reporting

### Security Implementation

Security is implemented with multiple layers:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Form input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
   - Parameter validation for API requests
   - Type checking and constraint enforcement

2. **Session Security**
   - Session timeout management in `SessionTracker` class
   - CSRF token protection for form submissions
   - Session binding to IP addresses (optional)

3. **Encryption**
   - Data encryption at rest for sensitive information
   - TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit
   - Key rotation and management for encryption keys

### Reporting System

The reporting functionality is extensive:

1. **Report Generation**
   - Reports defined in dedicated classes
   - SQL queries for data extraction
   - Multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, CSV)

2. **Clinical Quality Measures**
   - CQM reporting for regulatory compliance
   - Automated data extraction from patient records
   - Customizable measure definitions

### Interoperability Features

OpenEMR implements advanced interoperability:

1. **FHIR Resource Mapping**
   - OpenEMR data structures are mapped to FHIR resources
   - Conversion handled by specialized service classes
   - Supports various search parameters

2. **SMART App Launch Framework**
   - Context-aware app launching
   - Patient and user context passing
   - Single sign-on capabilities

3. **Bulk Data Export**
   - Supports FHIR bulk data export operations
   - System-level, patient-level, and group-level exports
   - Asynchronous processing for large datasets

### Frontend Framework

The frontend implements a hybrid approach:

1. **Legacy UI Components**
   - Traditional PHP-rendered templates
   - jQuery for DOM manipulation
   - Bootstrap for responsive layouts

2. **Modern JavaScript Components**
   - ES6+ JavaScript modules
   - AJAX for asynchronous data loading
   - Client-side rendering for complex interfaces

3. **CSS Organization**
   - Theme-based styling system
   - LESS/SASS preprocessing
   - Responsive design principles

## Conclusion
